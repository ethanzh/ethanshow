<i>
Pictures from Cheryl's second ultrasound, September 21, 1999, Stavanger.
</i>

<p>
The first two photos are head shots, with the first much more
clear than the second.  What a good-looking baby!  The third
is a view of the little guy's femur.  You can see the cursors
the doctor used to measure it.  Everything looks normal and
healthy.  Due date is <b>December 3rd</b>.
Lots of measurements are present on the final picture as well, if
you can figure out what they are.  "VKT 1839g" is an estimation of
the weight.  1.8 kilos so far.
