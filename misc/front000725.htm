<p>
An update is in progress on July 25.  (I need to do this more frequently!)
June is complete, with new photos and descriptions.  July photos are
coming...

<p>
The previous update was on Tuesday June 20, when almost a hundred photos
from Ethan's trip to Texas in February were added, along with about 75
from April, May, and June.

<p>
Please let me know if you have any
