<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the new home of the Ethan Show on the web, ethanshow.com! (Don't let the .com fool you, this site will always be available free of charge!) Finally, a <strong>permanent</strong> location for the site with <strong>faster</strong> downloads, and an address that is <strong>very easy to remember</strong>.
<p>Last <strong>update on July 2, 2001</strong>, with hundreds of photos through June of this year.
<p>Photos from November and December 2000, and May 2001 have not been posted yet. (And, my witty comments are missing from many months!).
