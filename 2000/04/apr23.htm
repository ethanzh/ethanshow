We spent Easter 2000 with our friends Barbara and Mark Norris
in Aberdeen, Scotland.  We woke up to sunshine and blue skies,
which is not guaranteed in this part of the world.  Breakfast
of soft-boiled eggs and hot cross buns in the sunroom got our
day started.  Then, after the photo shoot, we all drove north to
the town of Sandend to Alex and Christine's getaway cottage by the
sea, for a wonderful lunch.  Unfortunately, the weather had 
deteriorated by then, and we were unable to roll Easter eggs
on the beach.

Ethan's first Easter <i>nest</i>, or rather his initial
spelled with daffodils.  Under the cover of darkness, Cheryl
and Barbara pinched these daffodils the previous night from
nearby walking trails.  Barbara's reputation in the community
will never be the same.
