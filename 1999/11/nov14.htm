Ethan seemed to find his lungs today.  After a day with our heads in the
clouds on Saturday, things seemed a little more down to earth today.  The
poor guy was probably not getting enough to eat, and was really letting us
know about it.  Dad did get to feed him with a bottle, but this only offered
temporary relief.  What we really need is for Mom's breasts to kick in!
Also notice the bilirubin light, since our little man has a bit of a yellow
jaundice tinge.
