"How long will I be too small for all of my clothes?"

"We attended a nice Thanksgiving dinner at Colette's house today.
But, since it was my first night out, and I didn't really know what was
going on, I cried.  A lot.  Over and over again.  I didn't stop even
after Mom fed me or changed my diaper.  Or after they took me home.
I guess this is why Dad didn't take any good photos of me today."
