What a little angel he was today.  After yesterday's tantrums, he was quite
quiet and content today.  He managed to sleep through the two visitors of the
day, and continued his pattern of waking up as soon as the visitors leave.
People would be beginning to wonder if he has eyes, if not for these photos.
Unfortunately, the end of the day brought the news that the jaundice was not
going away.  You know what that means--time to catch a few more rays!  For
24 hours (except for feedings, of course).  This time in a double-decker
bilirubin bed with accompanying sunglasses.  Mom's not too happy about this,
but what else is there to do?
