Ethan writes his own column today.
<UL>
What a life!  A guy just tries to get some sleep and people keep shaking
him and poking him and trying to get him to wake up and suck a breast.
It makes me kind of miss the old days, always floating in a warm, dreamy
environment, with the food delievered automatically.  No need to even make
a phone call.
<p>Visitors keep streaming in, but I try to keep my eyes closed
when they're around.  At least today I finally got to meet a girl close to
my own age.  As you can see I was a bit shy--but hey, it was my first time!
And, I had some trouble with the fact that she was about twice as big as
I am.  After the nice guests left I thought it was a good time to test out
my new eyes and take a look around.  I might be able to get used to this.
And, by the way, what was that guy thinking when he bought those glasses?
