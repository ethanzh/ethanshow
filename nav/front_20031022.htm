<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the home of the Ethan Show on the web, ETHANshow.com!
<p>There have not been any <strong>major updates</strong> for quite some time.  The <strong>major news</strong> is that Ethan, Aidan, and family have moved to Malmö, Sweden!  To celebrate, I have finally added some new photos from <strong>October 2003</strong>.  There are some particularly good photos of Aidan, with links to <strong>print quality files</strong>.  Alas, the Parisian logo must soon make way for something Swedish, but I need some time to come up with something new.  And as always, I will try to fill in some of the other months soon.
<p>To request a copy of the <strong>entire site on CD</strong> or to <b>get a print quality photo</b>, <a href="mailto:chad@ethanshow.com?subject=Ethan Show CD"> click this link to send an email to chad@ethanshow.com</a>.  You can probably still <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/ethanshow" target="_blank">purchase some ETHAN show with the original logo</a>.  (The link will open a new window.)
