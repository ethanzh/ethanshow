<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the home of the Ethan Show on the web, ETHANshow.com!
<p>Another <strong>long overdue update</strong> is in underway.  Finally, a new logo to reflect the current country of residence!  The site is obviously not only dedicated to Ethan anymore, but I'll sort out a new domain name later.

<p>
Keep in mind that the photos posted on this site have been reduced in size, in order to make browsing faster.  So, they might not look great if you try to print them.

You can probably still <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/ethanshow" target="_blank">purchase some ETHAN show with the original logo</a>.  (The link will open a new window.) Please let me know if you have any <a href="mailto:c.houston@ethanshow.com?subject=Ethan Show Feedback">comments or suggestions</a>, or just <a href="mailto:c.houston@ethanshow.com?subject=I Love the ETHAN show!">drop me a line to let me know you visited</a>.
