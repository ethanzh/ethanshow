<p><strong>Welcome</strong> to the home of the Ethan Show on the web, ETHANshow.com!
<p>A <strong>major update is in progress in April 2003</strong>.  Both <strong>March</strong> and <strong>April</strong> 2003 are up to date.  The major news is that Ethan has a new little brother, named <strong>Aidan</strong>.  Also, a new logo, with a Parisian motif to replace the wagon.  Ethan's tricycle has displaced his wagon as the preferred mode of transportation.  And, of course, hundreds of new photos for November 2002 and March 2003.  Hopefully I can continue to fill in the other months soon.
<p>As always, to request a copy of the <strong>entire site on CD</strong> or to <b>get a print quality photo</b>, <a href="mailto:chad@ethanshow.com?subject=Ethan Show CD"> click this link to send an email to chad@ethanshow.com</a>.  You can probably still <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/ethanshow" target="_blank">purchase some ETHAN show with the old logo</a>.  (The link will open a new window.)
